        # errors=panic -- The worker is unusable if the mount isn't writable. So

        # filesystem. Since we don't have a separate journal device, this probably
        # does little. But in theory it relaxes durability so it shouldn't hurt.

        # nobarrier -- Loosen restrictions around writes to journal.

        # commit=60 -- By default, ext4 tries to sync every 5s to ensure
        # minimal data loss in case of system failure. We increase that to 60s to
        # avoid excessive filesystem sync. The filesystem will still write out
        # changes in the background. And a `sync()` issued by an application can
        # still force a full flush sooner. But ext4 itself won't be flushing all
